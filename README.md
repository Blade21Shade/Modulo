# Modulo
Make a custom modulo function

## Why I made this
Looking online, specifically on reddit at r/learnprogramming, I've seen multiple people request aid in dealing with recursion.
I never commented on these threads but I they got me thinking about what a could recursive function would look like that wasn't one of the basics such as fibbonaci
I thought that making a modulus operator would work well since in my head I can see the modulus function in a recursive context
