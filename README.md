# Modulo
Make a custom modulo function

## Why I made this
Looking online, specifically on reddit at r/learnprogramming, I've seen multiple people request aid in dealing with recursion.
I never commented on these threads but I they got me thinking about what a could recursive function problem would look like that wasn't one of the well known ones such as fibbonaci.

I thought that making a modulus operator would work well since in my head I can see the modulus function in a recursive context.

However, I didn't want to only do recursion since I also knew modulus could probably be done in other ways, my first guess was through some multiplication, so I also wanted to try making other functions that would work.

## Is this done yet?
No, I've started working on my non-recursive methods but haven't made them all yet.
